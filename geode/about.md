# ${PROJECT_NAME}

GD does not load the gradients correctly, this is because the format of the textures is in <cr>RGBA4444</c>, so this mod changes it to <cg>RGBA8888</c>.


## <co>Converted for Geode</c>
---

<cr>This is traditional mod that uses minhook, gd.h, cocos-haders!

BUT! In general, this mod works, and IN MOST CASES IT is COMPATIBLE.
